# Academic_Projects_DCU
This repository includes some of the projects I worked in during my undergraduate at Dublin City University.

House_Prices_Analysis - An assignment that analysed a dataset containing prices and other variables for 21,613 homes. This project included the use of descriptive statistics, visuals, linear regression and diagnostic tests. 
Tasks:
1. Describe the dataset using any appropriate descriptive statistics and visuals.
2. Develop a theoretical model, based on prior research, of how house prices are determined
based on house features.
3. Test, using linear regression, your proposed theoretical model to explain house prices and analyse the findings.
4. Run all suitable diagnostic tests on the regression specification, making improvements to the regression specification where necessary. Discuss the issues and changes made.


Irish_Banks_Analysis - An Assignment analysing the stock prices of AIB and Bank of Ireland, as well as using machine learnign techniques on the previous House_Prices_Analysis data.
Tasks:
1. Describe both banks individually using any appropriate descriptive statistics and visuals, including ARMA processes and unit roots.
2. Forecasting:
2a. Show how you might forecast both series individually using their ARMA processes.
2b. Analyse the volatility of both series individually and demonstrate how a GARCH
process can be used to model their volatility.
2c. Develop a VAR model of the two series and show how one series might influence the other.
3. Use appropriate machine learning techniques to develop a model to explain house prices.
