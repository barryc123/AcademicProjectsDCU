This repository includes some of the projects I worked on during my undergraduate degree at Dublin City University.

Irish_Banks_Analysis - An Assignment analysing the stock prices of AIB and Bank of Ireland, as well as using machine learning techniques on the previous House_Prices_Analysis data.
Tasks:
1. Describe both banks individually using any appropriate descriptive statistics and visuals, including ARMA processes and unit roots.
2. Forecasting:
2a. Show how you might forecast both series individually using their ARMA processes.
2b. Analyse the volatility of both series individually and demonstrate how a GARCH
process can be used to model their volatility.
2c. Develop a VAR model of the two series and show how one series might influence the other.
3. Use appropriate machine learning techniques to develop a model to explain house prices.
